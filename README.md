# üéÆ GMAE - Game Master Automated Ethereum

<h4 align="center">
  A Smart Contract game with a Verifiable Backend
</h4>

A Smart Contract game with a Verifiable Backend where players compete in procedurally generated worlds, mine resources, and compete for ETH prizes. Built on Ethereum with provably fair randomness and cryptographic verification of all game actions.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using **Scaffold-ETH 2**: NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and TypeScript.

## üåü Features

- üó∫Ô∏è **Verifiable Map Generation**: Complete map revealed at game end, deterministically generated from the on-chain random hash - players can verify the entire world was fair
- üèÜ **Stake-based Competition**: Players stake ETH to join games and compete for the prize pool
- üéÆ **Real-time Gameplay**: Move, mine, and compete in a responsive 3x3 grid interface
- üîê **Cryptographic Authentication**: Secure player authentication via wallet signatures
- üì± **Mobile-friendly UI**: Responsive design with QR code sharing for easy access
- üéä **Automated Payouts**: Smart contract handles prize distribution with 1% gamemaster fee
- ‚è∞ **Timeout Protection**: Players can withdraw stakes if gamemaster abandons the game
- üó∫Ô∏è **Radar System**: Real-time minimap showing explored territories
- ‚úÖ **Full Transparency**: After each round, the complete map is displayed with verification that all tiles match the deterministic generation

## üéÆ How to Play

### For Players

1. **Join a Game**: Connect your wallet and stake the required ETH to join an open game
2. **Wait for Start**: Games begin when the creator closes them (or after 2.5min timeout)
3. **Sign In**: Authenticate with your wallet to access the game interface
4. **Explore & Mine**:
   - Move around the 3x3 grid by clicking adjacent tiles
   - Mine resources at your current position (limited mines per player)
   - Collect points: Common (1pt), Uncommon (5pts), Rare (10pts), Treasure (special)
5. **Compete**: Race against other players within the time limit to maximize your score
6. **Win Prizes**: Top scorers share 99% of the prize pool equally

### For Game Creators

1. **Create Game**: Set gamemaster address and stake amount
2. **Commit Randomness**: Gamemaster commits a hash for provable fairness
3. **Open Game**: Players can join after hash commitment
4. **Start Game**: Close the game to begin the competition
5. **Payout Winners**: Gamemaster distributes prizes to top scorers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract (`YourContract.sol`)

The core game logic is handled by a Solidity contract that manages:

- **Game Creation**: Anyone can create games with custom stake amounts
- **Player Management**: Join games by staking ETH, track player states
- **Commit-Reveal Randomness**: Provably fair map generation using blockhash + reveal
- **Payout System**: Automated prize distribution to winners
- **Timeout Protection**: Players can withdraw if gamemaster abandons

Key functions:

- `createGame(gamemaster, stakeAmount)` - Create new game
- `joinGame(gameId)` - Join game with ETH stake
- `commitHash(gameId, hash)` - Gamemaster commits random hash
- `revealHash(gameId, reveal)` - Reveal for map generation
- `closeGame(gameId)` - Start the game
- `payout(gameId, winners)` - Distribute prizes

### Frontend (`packages/nextjs/`)

React-based game interface featuring:

- **Game Discovery**: Browse and join available games
- **Real-time Interface**: WebSocket-like polling for game state
- **Interactive Map**: 3x3 grid with movement and mining
- **Radar System**: Minimap showing explored areas
- **Wallet Integration**: RainbowKit for wallet connections
- **QR Code Sharing**: Easy game sharing via QR codes
- **Map Verification Display**: Post-game complete map visualization with tile-by-tile verification against explored areas

Key pages:

- `/` - Game browser and creation
- `/game/[gameId]` - Individual game interface
- `/debug` - Contract interaction tools

### Backend API

External gamemaster server (not included in this repo) handles:

- **Game State Management**: Track player positions, scores, moves
- **Real-time Updates**: Game timer, player actions, map state
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens from wallet signatures
- **Map Logic**: Procedural generation using contract randomness

API endpoints:

- `GET /status?gameId=X` - Game status and timer
- `GET /players?gameId=X` - Player leaderboard
- `GET /map?gameId=X` - Player's map view
- `POST /move` - Player movement
- `POST /mine` - Resource mining
- `POST /register` - Player authentication

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Map Generation & Verification

1. **Commit Phase**: Gamemaster commits `keccak256(secret)` to contract
2. **Reveal Phase**: After game closes, gamemaster reveals `secret`
3. **Randomness**: `randomHash = keccak256(blockhash + secret)` ensures fairness
4. **Map Size**: `mapSize = 1 + (4 √ó playerCount)` for scalable difficulty
5. **Procedural Generation**: Deterministic map creation using `randomHash`
6. **Post-Game Verification**: Complete map displayed to all players with tile-by-tile verification
7. **Transparency**: Players can verify their explored tiles match the deterministically generated map, proving no cheating occurred

### Resource Types

- **Common (1)**: 1 point, blue tiles
- **Uncommon (2)**: 5 points, green tiles
- **Rare (3)**: 10 points, orange tiles
- **Treasure (X)**: Special scoring, gold tiles
- **Depleted (0)**: No points, gray tiles

### Player Limits

- **Moves**: Start with limited movement actions
- **Mines**: Limited mining actions per player
- **Time**: Games have countdown timers for urgency

### Prize Distribution

- **Prize Pool**: Sum of all player stakes
- **Gamemaster Fee**: 1% to gamemaster for running the game
- **Winner Split**: 99% split equally among top scorers
- **Timeout Protection**: Players can withdraw stakes if no payout
